    Bullseye Release Notes</h2>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.1 2010-01-05</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial release installed on ddart-ltc-rom2.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.2 2010-01-06</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added invalid parameter handler.</li>
    <li>Allow canceling of sub-orders in the following states: REPLACED, REPLACEDPENDING,
      REPLACEREJECTED.&nbsp; This is in addition to the previously supported states of
      NEW, OPEN, and PARTIALLYFILLED.</li>
  </ul>
    <h3>
      v0.0.0.3 2010-01-06</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed locking on Connection_Manager objects</li>
    <li>Cleaned up message logging</li>
    <li>Added shutdown function to market data DLL and trigger to shutdown in wrapper
      class destructor</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.4 2010-01-07</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Added CRITICAL DART logging level indicating an extremely dire, most likely fatal,
      issue has been encountered.</li>
    <li>Check are now made to ensure there is only one algo engine process running on
      a server at one time.&nbsp; Multiple algo engines on a single server are not currently
      supported.</li>
    <li>ROM destination is now configured from the INI file using the OutboundHost and
      OutboundPort keys in the Bullseye section.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.5 2010-01-08</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="text-decoration: underline"><em>BUG FIX</em></span>: In quote lookups, only CTA was working.&nbsp; Subscriptions were fine,
      but the new code for doing quote lookups only did CTA symbols and skipped NASDAQ.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG WORKAROUND:</span></em> Server
      session state does not seem to be working properly in transition from the LOGGED_ON
      state to DISCONNECTED and then to CONNECTED.&nbsp; A ROM logon message is received
      while the server session state seems to be in DISCONNECTED state completely missing
      the DISCONNECTED-&gt;CONNECTED state transition.&nbsp; Adding better logging and
      automatic state transition from DISCONNECTED-&gt;CONNECTED when receiving a message
      in the DISCONNECTED state.&nbsp; This doesn't solve the underlying state transition
      problem but will work for now and allow additional troubleshooting.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">ENHANCEMENT:</span></em> Detection
      of missing market data is now controlled by two INI settings, [Bullseye]MdNoDataPollIntervalMs
      and [Bullseye]MdNoDataMaxPollCount.&nbsp; The first configures the number of milliseconds
      to wait before re-polling the market data system for a price block for the given
      symbol.&nbsp; This only kicks in after the initial query.&nbsp; The second controls
      the number of times to retry before determining market data to be unavailable and
      rejecting the order.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">ENHANCEMENT:</span></em> The trader
      used on all outbound orders to the exchange can now be configured via the [Bullseye]ClientUsername
      key in the INI file.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX:</span></em> Null character
      sent after the newline terminator on query commands, this was causing issues when
      ultimately passed to ROC.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.6 2010-01-12</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">ENHANCEMENT:</span></em> Switched
      internal time keeping from time_t (CRT) to ACE_Time_Value to allow for enhanced
      (sub-second) time calculations.&nbsp; ACE_Time_Value should be just as portable.&nbsp;
      This required a fairly significant reworking of all the time calculation code but
      should allow somewhat more accurate time slice partitioning for small time periods
      and better overall fitting with very large time slices.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX:</span></em> CSV_EXEC_TIME
      was not being sent on customer order executions.&nbsp; The net effect was that opening
      a ROC trades window after the fills came in had the fills incorrectly marked with
      the time the window was opened.&nbsp; Sending CSV_EXEC_TIME causes ROC to always
      use this time when displaying the trades no matter when the Trades window is opened.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX:</span></em> Instead of sending
      market orders in some instances a limit order with no price would be sent; all market
      orders are now sent as such and limit orders should always have a limit price.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX:</span></em> Enhanced decision
      engine locking is needed with the new thread-pool Reactor-based event scheme.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.7 2010-01-12</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">ENHANCEMENT:</span></em> Added INI
      settings to configure market start/stop times (convenient for testing).&nbsp; Both
      are in the "Bullseye" section and are "NYMarketStart" and "NYMarketEnd".&nbsp; Both
      should be strings of the form HH:MM (note that this is on a 24-hour clock) and are
      in New York local time.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.8 2010-01-13</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX:</span></em> If a cancel-replace
      was rejected the TWAP order would report the TWAP order as canceled but would continue
      working it.&nbsp; Now it properly stops working the order.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.0.9 2010-01-29</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX:</span></em> Bad use of varargs
      in DART_WARNING (passed STL strign as char*).&nbsp; Causes crash sometimes when
      requesting market data.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX:</span></em> Misuse of ACE_Time_Value,
      comparing against default values. Causes time functions to fail initialization.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">FEATURE:</span></em> Utilize ExDest
      from original order for routing (setting the Exchange field) for all sub-orders
      created by the algo engine while working the original algo order.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">BUG FIX</span></em>: Null pointer
      check to prevent access violation on shutdown; only happens when market data DLL
      could not be loaded.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Enhancement:</span></em> No longer
      setting ExDest on any orders created by the algo-engine.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
    v0.0.1.0 2010-02-26</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Enhancement:</span></em> Add CSV_PARENT
      tag on all sub-orders generated while working a customer order.</li>
    <li><em><span style="text-decoration: underline">Enhancement:</span></em> Add Customer
      Directed Order functionality in which the customer specifies the order type (market/limit),
      limit price, and exchange destination to be used on each suborder sent on behalf
      of the client.&nbsp; The only thing the TWAP algorithm does is to determine the
      order volume and timing used to send the orders.&nbsp; Since no changes to the order
      price are made in response to market conditions, market data is not needed.</li>
  </ul>
