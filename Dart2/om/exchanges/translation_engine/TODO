1. All map data structures are hash maps of 1024 buckets.  It's
possible that Red-Black Trees or a different number of hash buckets
would be more appropriate.

2. There are memory leaks all over!  Those need to be fixed and the
biggest culprit is probably the token.data.token fields returned when
parsing symbols.  There are probably also problems with memory leaking
when free'ing various objects, but that should be easy to isolate once
the free method of each object is inspected closely.

3. Add a function to generate a ClOrdID.  Since op_t objects can hold
their own state, they can be used to generate ClOrdIDs.  There can
even be multiple functions depending on what is needed.  For instance,
a function that generates day-unique ClOrdIDs can be separate from a
basic one and separate still from a branch code one.

4. Add a timestamp function to generate the UTC FIX format timestamp.
That way 52 and 60 can be done with a rule.

5. I noticed that when parsing stops because of an error past the
beginning of the file a result is still generated, but only complete
up to the point in which the error was encountered.  This should be
fixed so that an error anywhere is reported up and the rules are no
good.
