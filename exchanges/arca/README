Arca GCCG Gateway
----------------- 

The main difference is the login message.  In it, the client can
specify session behavior on login through the specification of a
series of FIX tag 96 values that roughly correspond to bits,
i.e. pieces of functionality that are turned on or off.  These "bits"
are order-dependent, obviously, and can be extended by Arca at any
time.  Subsequent bits not specified in the message take on default
values as specified by Arca.

The current "bits" (defaults in parentheses) are:

1. Cancel on disconnect (0)
2. Send Busts and Correct Messages (1)
3. Send Liquidity Indicator (1)
4. Send ArcaExID (0)
5. Default Extended ExecInst (Z - Do not default)
6. Send ExecBroker (0)
7. Default ProactiveIfLocked (0)

Other than cancel on disconnect, the rest are fine as defaults.
