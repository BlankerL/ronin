    <h1>Symbology</h1>
    Since our internal symbology is largely based off of CMS symbology we are
    parsing symbols, breaking them up into two parts based on the presence of
    a forward-slash character ('/'), and placing the root symbol (before the
    slash) into FIX field 55 (Symbol) and the suffix into FIX field 65
    (SymbolSfx); no translation of the suffix is required.  See
    <a href="http://www.batstrading.com/resources/membership/BATS_Symbology.pdf">this document</a> for more information.

    <h1>Side</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy (54=1)</li>
      <li>Sell (54=2)</li>
      <li>Sell Short (54=5, 114=N)</li>
    </ul>
    LocateReqd (FIX Tag 114) is automatically sent as "N" for shorts.

    <h1>Order Types</h1>

    <h2>Reserve Orders</h2>
    The number of shares to display can be sent in ROM field 34 which is mapped
    to MaxFloor (FIX tag 111).  This value is ignored by BATS on IOC orders.

    <h2>Market Orders</h2>

    <h2>Limit Orders</h2>

    <h2>Pegged Orders</h2>
    The ROM type field is ignored for these types of orders (ROM field 8).
    Instead, the ROM Execution Instruction field (ROM field 57) is inspected.
    If ROM field 57 contains either "P", "M", or "R", the order is considered
    a Pegged order and the FIX OrdType field (FIX tag 40) is set to "P".  The
    FIX ExecInst field (tag 18) is automatically mapped rom ROM tag 57 via the
    configuration file.  BATS will only allow Pegged orders to be placed if
    they are not routable, therefore Pegged orders must be placed with 9303=B
    to indicate a RoutingInst of BATS (BYX) only.  This is done by default
    based on the default routing instruction configuration in the configuration
    file.  The DisplayIndicator field (FIX tag 9479) is "V" by default for
    Pegged orders.  Pegged order offsets are allowed and are copied from ROM
    field 64 into PegDifference (FIX tag 211).  This is handled by default via
    the mapping tables in the handler.

    <h2>Add Liquidity Only</h2>
    This is an order type provided by DART Executions across several
    destinations that translates to the destination-specific tags required to
    only add liquidity to a particular market center's book.  For BYX this
    amounts to settings the RoutingInst field (FIX tag 9303) to "B" to park the
    order on the BATS book and not allow routing out.  Additionally, the
    DisplayIndicator field (FIX tag 9479) is set to "V".  On BATS BYX this
    should enable price sliding for the order.

    <h2>Minimum Quantity</h2>
    ROM message field 18 is mapped to the MinQty FIX tag (110) to indicate the
    minimum number of shares acceptable for matching.

    <h1>Knobs To Turn for BYX (Configuration Options)</h1>

    <h2>Default Routing Instructions</h2>
    Default routing instructions to be placed into FIX tag 9303 are configured
    via the "DefaultRoutingInstruction" key in the "FIX Information" section of
    the configuration file.  This default value is used if the ROM Instructions
    field (CSV field 15) is empty.
    <i>No validation is done either on the default value specified or routing
      instructions passed in the ROM message.  This is <b>by design</b> to
      reduce maintenance.</i>

    <h2>Clearing ID</h2>
    Each order sent to BYX must have clearing information attached in FIX tag
    439 (ClearingFirm).  Since this is the same for all orders (but may possibly
    change in the future) it is configured via the "ClearingID" key in the
    "FIX Information" section of the configuration file.
