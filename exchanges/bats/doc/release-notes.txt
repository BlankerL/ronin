2010-12-13 v2.0.0
* First release of BATS destination with new framework. 

2010-12-15 v2.0.1
* Default ExecInst to 'w' (Do Not DRT)

2010-12-15 v2.0.2
* Bug fix: ExecInst not needed on cancel or cancel/replace messages; processing
  was failing when not receiving field 57 (CSV_EXEC_INSTRUCTION) from ROM.

2010-12-16 v2.0.3
* BZX support: Set the FIX Account (1) field in pre-translate step,
  ClearingAccount (440) and Account (1) are needed for BZX but the mapping file
  allows for only mapping one of the two fields.  With this configuration, the
  handler will automatically send Account (1) if the ClearingAccount (440) is
  configured in the RomToFixOut mapping file.

* Bug fix: SenderSubID was being sent twice.
