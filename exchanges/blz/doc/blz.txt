Belzberg treats the FIX tag 100 (ExDestination) as the listing exchange and FIX
tag 113 (ReportToExch) as the routing destination. These are very FIX unfriendly
ways to send this information. The listing exchange should be in FIX tag 207
(SecurityExchange), and the routing destination should be in FIX tag 100
(ExDestination).
