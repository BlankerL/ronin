2010-12-07 v1.0.0
* Initial Belzberg version

2010-12-08 v1.0.1
* Bug fix: Release build is now built using ASCII libraries instead of Unicode.

2011-01-12 v1.0.2
* Bug fix: Removed RawData and RawDataLength fields from Logon message; they
  probably don't hurt but definitly aren't needed for this destination.
* Feature: Use the ROM Destination field (ROM field 13) to map to the proper
  FIX ExDest (tag 100) field on New Order - Single messages (35=D).
* Feature: Add configurable mapping for Destination to ExDest fields using the
  [BLZ] DestMap key in the INI file.
* Feature: New day processing (resetting ROM and FIX sequence numbers and
  purging sequence files) works with the new framework logic such that anytime
  the Last Run Day in the config file differs from the calculated current run
  day sequence numbers are reset and sequence files are purged.  The time
  used is the current day as determined by the CRT function localtime.

2011-01-20 v1.0.3
* Feature: FIX constants can now be configured by setting the FixConstants key
  in the BLZ section of the configuration file.  The full <tag>=<value> syntax
  of the FIX tag constant must be provided and will simply be inserted into
  each message verbatim.  For example:
    [BLZ]
    FixConstants=6750=CL
  In this example "6750=CL" will be inserted into the FIX message, along with a
  FIX field separator (0x01) in each message.
* Spec change: Tag 50 is not needed for clearing; the *last* 4 characters of the
  clearing account are to be sent in FIX tag 1 (Account).

2011-02-01 v1.0.4
* Update: Modified to use latest framework.

2011-02-03 v1.0.5
* Feature: Map capacity of 'A' to 'CL', required for Canadian equity trading.

2011-02-03 v1.0.6
* Bug fix: Capacity not sent on Cancel or Cancel/Replace messages; now saves
  capacity in the internal order book.
* Bug fix: Under certain circumstances the ExDest tag would not be sent for
  New Order - Single messages.

2011-02-03 v1.0.7
* Changed resource file, no code changes from v1.0.6 but cannot re-tag in git
  repository.

2011-02-16 v1.0.8
* Modified symbol handling code to strip either .TO or .TV extensions from the
  symbol before sending out.  Existing suffix handling, e.g. B shares as
  expressed in a symbol such as SU.B will load 55 with the symbol 'SU' and 65
  with the suffix 'B'.  '.TO' and '.TV' will never be sent to BLZ and are only
  needed on the ROM message symbol for proper TPOS reporting.

2011-02-18 v1.1.0
* Framework: Do not log out the FIX session if receiving a SequenceReset (35=4)
  message without a GapFillFlag set (123=Y).  Belzber erroneously sends these
  before fulfilling ResendRequests and the implications are pretty unappealing
  if we don't drop this single erroneous message (we would never sync up on the
  FIX session and would have to handle missed messages manually).
* Framework: Read short locate ID, if any, from the database and store in
  internal order book.
* BLZ: Apply short locate ID from book if missing on ROM message.  This is
  needed for Cancel/Replaces of short orders.

2011-03-08 v1.1.1
* BLZ: FIX tag 100 should always be "TSES" while 113 will be the result (if any
  of mapping the destination ID to a string as specified in the configuration
  file.

2011-03-08 v1.1.2
* BLZ: Add full peg order support.

2011-03-10 v1.1.3
* BLZ: Strip commas from FIX text field.

2011-03-11 v1.1.4
* Suppress error messages resulting from the v1.1.3 change; no impact on actually
  processing the messages, just lots of messages to stdout.

2011-03-22 v1.1.5
* Bug fix: It was premature to remove the special CancelReject processing;
  problems still exist in Belzberg's implementation of CancelReject messages so
  the custom handling has been added back.
* Feature reversion: Tag 100 is now mapped from the mapping specified in the
  configuration file; previously this configuration mapped tag 113.

  Digression: There is a confusing set of changes surrounding this "feature
  reversion". The root cause is needing to send peg orders to Chi-X. Originally,
  we were told to specify 113=CHIX to route to Chi-X. It turns out that tag,
  113, is a direction to the Smart Order Router (SOR). The SOR, however, does
  not support peg orders. In order to route peg orders we need Belzberg to allow
  us to access Chi-X directly, not through the SOR. Tag 100 (ExDestination)
  specifies what "destination" orders are routed to at Belzberg; sending
  "100=TSES" sends to the SOR while "100=CHIX" will send to Chi-X. Tag 113
  specifies directions to the SOR; however, we will not be specifying any
  directions to the SOR so tag 113 will not be used.

2011-04-06 v1.1.6
* Feature: Allow sell short exempt for Canadian markets. For a Sell Short order,
  if the short lender is "ETFX" the side is changed to Sell Short Exempt (54=6).
  This should only be done for ETFs, hence the ETFeXempt short lender acronym.
  Any other short lender or side combination will result in the normal mappings.

2011-06-30 v1.1.7
* Changed suffix mapping code to include a leading period in suffix on direction
  from Belzberg.

2011-09-21 v1.1.8
* Latest framework.
