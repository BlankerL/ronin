2013-01-29 boeopt-1.7

* Modified ClOrdID generation to include the date to ensure GTC orders
  have unique ClOrdIDs across days.

* Some changes to ex_common order token generation code to allow the
  above ClOrdID change.

* Simplified the (failed) genericization of ID generation within
  boeopt.  The new version simply uses the expanded token generator
  from ex_common.
