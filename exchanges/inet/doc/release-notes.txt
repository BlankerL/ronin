2011-11-09 v3.1.2
* Latest framework, addresses FIX parsing bug.

2011-12-20 v3.1.3
* New functionality for handling ABN AMRO clearing accounts. The SenderSubID
  field sent to INET is used at the end of month for billing purposes. This
  ID must be unique per clearing account so our billing charges are properly
  applied to Dart accounts at the end of the month. For the existing Goldman
  Sachs clearing accounts, the first four characters are unique per account
  and that is what we are currently using. However, for ABN AMRO clearing,
  only the last three or four characters are unique. To accommodate this,
  there is a new configuration setting in the FIX SERVER section called
  ClearingFirmName. This setting, if present, and set to "ABN AMRO", will
  cause the current clearing account translaction function to be swapped out
  for an ABN AMRO specific one that uses the last four characters of the
  clearing account ID in the SenderSubID.
