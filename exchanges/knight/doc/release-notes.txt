A note about algo support:
The only certified algorithm is Arrival Price. For Arrival Price the following
table shows the supported fields:

Name    Description             FIX Field      Data Type
oo      OnOpen                  6206           Y/N
oc      OnClose                 6207           Y/N
iwould  I Would Price           6208           Price
mvp     Max Vol Pct             6209           Float
style   Style                   6210           Float
10b-18  10b-18                  6212           Y/N
msp     Market Stop Price       6258           Price
ds      Dark Switch             6260           Y/N
dmq     Dark Min Qty            6261           Qty
dur     Duration                6263           Int

The "Name" column indicates the name to be provided in ROM field 15
(Instructions). As with other algo destinations, field 15 should contain a
space-separated list of name=value pairs that represent the algo parameters.
Additionally, fields 76 and 77 (Begin and End Time) will map to begin and end
times on the FIX session. Finally, AlgoType (ROM field 73) must contain a
"4" for the Arrival Price algo.

2011-11-14 v1.2.1
* Added 57=ALGO (TargetSubID) for algo orders. Any order send to the algo
  destination (ROM field 13), as determined by the configuration
  ("Algo Dest ID" in the "FIX SERVER" section of the INI file) will
  automatically be tagged with 57=ALGO.

2011-12-16 v1.2.2
* Added Option translation code.

2012-02-27 v1.3.0
* Removed dependence on the algo destination being a separate destination
  re-routed to the Knight handler separate from the normal equity order flow.
  This was done to make sure algo orders were tagged as going to a TargetSubID
  of "ALGO" but causes too many destinations defined now that we have multiple
  clearing firms. This version simply looks at the ALGOTYPE (73) field to see
  if this is an algorithm order; if so it adds 57=ALGO.
