* Add account information to cancel/replace and cancel messages.  This
  is required by REDI otherwise the order is canceled upon receiving a
  cancel/replace without account information.  The account information
  is saved from the original order, if needed.

* We have seen a strange situation in which a cancel/reject is set
  pending (150=6), accepted (150=5), but then rejected (35=9) with an
  OrdStatus of Rejected (39=8).  If this situation occurs we now
  change the status from replace rejected (20) to rejected (8) so the
  client knows the order is out.
