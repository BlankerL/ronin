pcx-3.1 2013-05-28

Allow additional configuration for the OnBehalfOfCompID (FIX 115)
field to accommodate changes with ABN AMRO clearing.  To add this, the
RomToFixOut mapping must be changed to map DART CSV field 11 (Clearing
Firm) to FIX tag 115.  Also, to run this mapping through a table, the
key ClearingFirmMap must be added to the FIX SERVER section.  The
syntax of the ClearingFirmMap is
"<fieldkey1>:<fieldval1>,<fieldkey2:fieldval2>,...".


pcx-3.2 2013-05-28

This is just a packaging change; the previous version did not include
libdartcomplex.so, which is required for pcx.
