	* rash-1.4: Build problem (server objects) with rash-1.3; fixed in
	rash-1.4.

	* rash-1.3

	* rash.c: Log RASH messages (thereby timestamping them) before
	processing them; we were logging after sending back to ROM.

	* framework: Now includes microsecond timestamping in the rolling
	log.

	* rash-1.1: Production release after certification test.

	* rash_util.c: Account for Central versus Eastern time zone when
	translating RASH timestamps into a UTC timestamp.  The RASH
	timestamp is the number of milliseconds since midnight Eastern
	time.  mktime is called to convert the time to UTC, assuming that
	the time specified is in the local time zone.  If the server is
	running in Chicago in the Central time zone, the resulting UTC
	time will be one hour in the future.  To address this, on startup
	we check the timezone and, if it is Central, set a flag indicating
	one hour must be subtracted from the time.  If it is Eastern time
	zone, no adjustment is made.
