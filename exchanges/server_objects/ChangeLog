	* rom_handler.c (handle_csv_logon): If only one message is sent to
	a disconnected ROM, when ROM reconnects that single message will
	not be resent.  This only applies for the case of 1 message, if
	more than one message has been sent to the ROM the resending
	happens correctly.

	* databuf.c (databuf_reserve): The difference between the
	requested buffer size and the current space left is calculated
	twice yielding an incorrect size to grow by as passed to
	databuf_reserve.

	* client_manager.c (dart_rolling_log_going_iovec): Fixed iovec
