TSX (Toronto Stock eXchange)

tsx-1.1
* Latest version with latest framework.

tsx-1.0 Initial version.  Uses TSX SOR (Smart Order Router) to conform
to the Canadian Order Protection Rule on Best Execution.  No routing
is enabled by removing DART CSV tag processing for field 13 from the
RomToFixOut configuration file.  If routing is needed, add this back
in to map to FIX tag 6780 and add a 'DestMap' key to the [TSX]
section.  The value of this field is a comma-separated list of DestID
to string mappings in the format
'DestID:<string>,DestID:<other-string>'.
