DART Glob

The main dartglob process takes one argument: the glob conf file. The
glob conf file contains all of the shared objects to be loaded, along
with the configuration file to go along with a configuration file to
be used with that file. Each line of shared object and configuration
represents a separate destination and is loaded separately.

One port is used to listen for messages from ROM. When messages are
received they are parsed and directed to the appropriate destination
instance.
